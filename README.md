# Multi-Agent Supervisor

Tools such as web search or SQL database querying can be assigned to one single AI agent. However, a more efficient way is to have multiple agents specialised in different tasks. The multi-agent supervisor is an architecture which specialised agents are coordinated by a central supervisor agent. The supervisor agent controls all communication flow and task delegation, making decisions about which agent to invoke based on the current context and task requirements.
